⭐ Pattern Printing in Java
This project demonstrates how to print various * patterns using Java. It is designed for beginners to understand nested loops and basic control flow.

### 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
  bash
git clone https://github.com/Shivaprasadt08/Patterns.git
cd PatternPrinting
java src.Pyramid
You can modify the number of rows inside each .java file to change the output.

🧠 Concepts Used
Nested loops

If-else statements

Formatting with spaces

Basic user input (can be extended)

📸 Output Example (Diamond.java for rows = 4)

✅ 1. Builds Strong Logic Skills
Pattern printing exercises train your mind to think in terms of loops, conditions, and nested structures.

It teaches control over flow — a key concept in any programming language.

✅ 2. Strengthens Understanding of Loops
You'll master for, while, and nested loops by visualizing how they control output line by line.

Understanding how i and j loop indexes work is crucial for interview coding rounds.

✅ 3. Foundation for Complex Programs
These patterns are like the “hello world” of logic building.

If you can break down a triangle, pyramid, or diamond pattern, you'll find it easier to work with 2D arrays, graphics, and matrix operations later.

✅ 4. Frequently Asked in Interviews
Pattern-based questions are common in interviews for freshers.

They test your grasp of logic, syntax, and output prediction — not just memorization.
